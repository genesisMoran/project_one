Project one

**PROJECT TITLE: Loliberrie**
The objective of the game is to help Loli collect the berries. Loli is given a total of 20 seconds at the start, if this goal is met she wins; if by the 20 seconds there are still berries left she must start over.

**MOTIVATION**
I have a small niece by the name of Lauren, her nickname is "Loli", given the task of making a game I instantly thought of her. My motivation is to ultimately have a polished game with different levels of complexity, which can test the child's quickness and teach them different berry names. It's meant to be both educational and fun.
