## Project one

**PROJECT TITLE: Loliberrie**
<p>The objective of the game is to help Loli collect the berries. Loli is given a total of 20 seconds at the start, if this goal is met she wins; if by the 20 seconds there are still berries left she must start over (aka game over).</p>

**MOTIVATION**
<p>I have a niece by the name of Lauren, her nickname is "Loli", given the task of making a game I instantly thought of her. Being that Loli is 3 years old, I adjusted the palette of this project to something I felt would appeal to her. My motivation is to ultimately have a polished game with different levels of complexity, which can test the child's quickness and teach them different berry names. Loliberrie is meant to be both educational and fun.</p>

**FEATURES**
- "Help Loli collect the berries" is the greeting which sets the start of my game. I used my voice for this.
- Every time the page is refreshed the berries are randomized. This was made possible using Math.random()
- Loli was made using divs
